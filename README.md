This repository demonstrates the implementation of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**. It is designed to help developers understand how to interact with relational databases in Java through JDBC.

## Features

- **Create**: Insert new records into the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display data from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or above).
2. A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) installed and configured.
3. A JDBC driver for your database (e.g., `mysql-connector-java` for MySQL).
4. Basic knowledge of SQL and Java programming.
